Yo so I'm going to make the code public in about 7-9 business days due to p2w server crashing, plugin dev, etc  

What you need  
Enable api settings for hypixel skyblock  
Need a discord account  (thought I should access the users profile with discord since they can link discord as a last stand)   
Minecraft ofc  
A Skyblock profile that you last logged on 7 days ago (idk why it's required to be 7 days)  

step 1: log in with Microsoft on http://surl.li/efvve  
reminder it shows you need to give access to discord do not be alarmed as sometimes it can't grab the user's profile with the microsoft access so it trys to access it with your discord account  
  
step 2: once you logged in it should show something like "Microsoft Successfully Authenticated"  
that means you are now using your microsoft/discord account to track your stats
  
step 3: once all of the above steps are completed go to https://me.hypizelsbstatz.rf.gd  
then you can see your skyblock networth and etc
